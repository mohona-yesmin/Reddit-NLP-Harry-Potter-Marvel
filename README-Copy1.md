### Description


### The Data Science Process

**Problem Statement**

Marketing companies aim to enhance their understanding of the preferences and behaviors of Harry Potter and Marvel fans on social media platforms to inform more effective targeted advertising strategies for Halloween merchandise. By doing so, they can maximize the impact of their pop-up ads for Halloween sales.

This involves collecting and analyzing data related to the online activities, interests, and demographics of Harry Potter and Marvel fans on subreddits, r/harrypotter and r/marvel. With this information, marketing companies can tailor their advertising campaigns to align with the specific preferences of these fan groups and deliver highly relevant and engaging content. This, in turn, increases the likelihood of attracting the attention of these fans, prompting them to explore and participate in the Halloween sales, ultimately leading to increased conversion rates and revenue for the marketing companies.
