lhqfxt,The scene in Chamber of Secrets when Mrs. Weasley tells Harry to eat hits way differently now.,"The first time through, I just kind of interpreted it as Mrs. Weasley's general motherliness, in the same way a grandma will tell you you're too skinny after feeding you three giant helpings of food.

But rereading it, I realized that she wasn't just worrying over nothing, Harry had been starved for weeks. The Dursleys were giving him the bare minimum of food, and what they were giving him (like cold canned soup that was mostly broth) had no real nutritious value. Harry mentions that he had been spending most of his time lying around on his bed and sleeping, probably because he didn't have the energy to do much else.

The book describes Mrs. Weasley as being incredibly angry, right up until one of the twins mentions they had been starving Harry. When she then takes a second to actually see what bad shape Harry is in, almost all of the anger goes out of her. She's still a bit strict with the boys, but nowhere near as furious as she had been. We know Mrs. Weasley specialized in healing magic as well as cooking, and likely recognized all the signs of malnutrition in Harry. When she then monitors Harry as he's eating, and keeps giving him more, it's not a joke, it's because that's likely the first real meal he's had since he left Hogwarts.

Finally, during the conversation and meal, she makes a point of letting Harry know she's not angry with *him* when she starts yelling, and then constantly gives Harry praise and positive reinforcement. In short, she's following the textbook guide for dealing with victims of abuse, and getting them settled into a safer place.

I just thought it was a truly nice moment that showed an adult actually being responsible and caring for Harry's emotional and physical well being, something that he had only experienced once or twice previously.",26918,977,EquivalentInflation,1613066447.0,0.93,Discussion,1613066447.0,True,"['Chamber of Secrets', 'Weasley', 'Harry', 'first', 'Weasley', 'three', 'Harry', 'weeks', 'Harry', 'Weasley', 'Harry', 'second', 'Harry', 'Weasley', 'Harry', 'Harry', 'first', 'Harry', 'Harry praise', 'Harry']",0.9356,0

Then, out of nowhere, he was gifted a *Firebolt* at Christmas. But there was no note. Someone bought him the most expensive broomstick on the market but didn't want him to know who it was from.

Naturally, I thought this would be suspicious for anyone, but on top of that, there's reason to believe that my friend is being targeted by a dangerous criminal. So I told our Head of House about the Firebolt and she confiscated it in case it had been cursed.

Now my friend has stopped speaking to me and I don't know what to do. My other best friend [M13] isn't speaking to me either because apparently to *boys* winning a Quidditch match is more important than not dying.

-----

Update:
He was a wonderfully written character but book!Snape was still a dumpster fire of a human being.

Alan Rickman's portrayal of him in the movies, however, was nuanced, brilliant, and absolutely sold me on the idea that maybe the was more to movie!Snape them I'd thought.

Meta Musing:
I didn't realize that this kind of post was considered to be ""a repost,"" but if you're truly that grumpy with either the ""repost"" that it represents or feel ""no you're wrong!"" then might I suggest simply downvoting the post and moving on without commenting?

Because the more you engage with it and the more comments you leave, the more redditors will make posts like this and more the reddit algorithm will promote them.

Clarification:
Being abused does not justify abusing others. Continuing the cycle condemns you, it doesn't free you. Sirius was probably as immature about Harry as Snape was, yes, but he'd also spent ""TWELVE YEARS!! IN AZKABAN!!"" so he's probably a bit twitchier them he'd be if he'd had twelve years to mature outside of Nightmare Wizard Prison.

Again, Snape is a Great Character, certainly one with more nuance than Lord ""Can't Even Kill A Baby.""

i9k7mw,Arthur's surprisingly large influence in the Ministry low-key symbolizes the theme of the series.,"At first glance, Arthur appears to be a pretty meaningless cog in the Ministry machine.

His job doesn't pay him that well, and the department he heads, officially, isn't very powerful. Quite the contrary, his job is seen as kind of a joke. Nobody really cares about his department, it's mentioned that it's literally just him and one other guy.

And yet, despite that, Arthur seems surprisingly well-connected. He's able to score the best possible seats money can buy to the Quidditch World Cup, he's able to push through his Muggle Protection Act despite being deeply unpopular with the rich and powerful, and several times mentions ""pulling strings"" or calling in favors within the Ministry throughout the series.

And again, his department is seen as a joke, so it's not like he's well connected because his position is powerful, it's the opposite, his position only has what little power it does because Arthur is well-connected.

And the actual reason as far as I can tell why he has so much pull is that ***people simply like him.*** They help him out because he's *nice.* Ludo Bagman gets him those perfects seats because Arthur had helped him previously, and all the Ministry employees (even Crouch) seem genuinely friendly with Arthur because he's earnestly, enthusiastically pleasant to every single person he meets. Arthur Weasley is revealed to be a much richer man than he first appears, but his wealth is in reputation in stead of gold.

And that's kind of the main theme of the entire series, isn't it? That true power is one's ability to connect with other people, to be *kind* to people, and being the kind of person that people want to help. It's a less extreme version of exactly what enables Harry to be the hero and win in the end.",14865,647,PetevonPete,1597404398.0,0.95,Discussion,1597404398.0,True,"['Arthur', 'Ministry', 'first', 'Arthur', 'Ministry', 'one', 'Arthur', 'the Quidditch World Cup', 'Muggle Protection Act', 'Arthur', 'Ludo Bagman', 'Arthur', 'Arthur', 'Arthur Weasley', 'first', 'Harry']",0.9929,0

But, imagine your movies were so bad THAT THE WRITER OF THE BOOKS HIMSELF TWEETS HOW MUCH HE HATES THEM

The basin is on a small island in the middle of a dark lake, and the only water you can drink is from said lake. That lake is filled with a giant army of inferi which of course can only be stopped by fire. You can only get to the basin in the middle of the lake by taking a boat that‚Äôs hidden at the bottom, and you can only find the boat by pulling on an invisible chain. The lake is in a cavern protected by a door that is practically undetectable to the unsuspecting wizard. The door can only be opened if you cut yourself and splatter your blood on the door. Oh, and the door is inside a random cave that‚Äôs super hard to get to in the first place.‚Äù

fxs61w,Fans who hate Dumbledore for ‚Äúraising Harry like a pig for slaughter‚Äù are forgetting something,"We are seeing that conversation in Snape‚Äôs memory, and Dumbledore simply did not tell Snape the full story. He never told anyone the whole story until he told it to Harry in the King‚Äôs Cross chapter. 

From the end of GoF, Dumbledore knew, or rather, he was extremely confident that Harry could no longer die by Voldemort‚Äôs hand. That is what the look of triumph in his eyes was when Harry told him about the blood Voldemort took from him. From that moment on, Dumbledore was trying to orchestrate a situation that would lead to Voldemort‚Äôs downfall with the least amount of sacrifice necessary. And he knew that in order to do that, Harry would need to sacrifice himself willingly. Not be told to die for others, but choose to of his own free will. 

Dumbledore could have had other very trustworthy people destroy the horcruxes. He had an entire group of highly devoted and skilled wizards at his disposal. But he needed it to be Harry - he needed Harry to see and fully understand what a perversion it was to seek immortality. Dumbledore leading the trio to the Deathly Hallows was also never meant to shield Harry from death - he was already protected. The Hallows were just meant to push Harry towards the inevitable conclusion: that the mastery of death is really the acceptance of death. If Harry understood this message, the choice would come naturally to him. 

He knew Harry couldn‚Äôt die. But if Harry thought he could, and chose to, the sacrifice magic would shield everyone in the second leg of the Battle, preventing many more casualties. The final thing to do was not to fight Voldemort with skill and power, but with the one thing he never understood, but which Harry had in spades: love for others.

That‚Äôs why he never told Snape, he wanted Harry to receive only partial information. He didn‚Äôt care if that made him a villain in Snape‚Äôs eyes, as long as it led to Harry choosing to die willingly. It was the ultimate ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù, but so very different from how Grindelwald used the term. Dumbledore sacrificed everything, including his life, but he won, as everything worked out as he thought or even better than he thought it would.

I am sorry if this was discussed before, but I am seeing a lot of mindless hate for Dumbledore based off that quote. It seems to have become almost a default opinion in the fandom that Dumbledore was cruel and uncaring for orchestrating Harry‚Äôs death. That he didn‚Äôt give him a choice (when in fact Harry‚Äôs choice was the instrumental part). 

Dumbledore was flawed. He spent his whole life hiding from power, regretting what he did as a young man. But he was the furthest thing from cruel.",12155,563,purpleKlimt,1586437899.0,0.94,Discussion,1586437899.0,True,"['Dumbledore', 'Harry', 'Snape', 'Dumbledore', 'Snape', 'Harry', 'King‚Äôs Cross', 'Dumbledore', 'Harry', 'Voldemort', 'Harry', 'Voldemort', 'Dumbledore', 'Voldemort', 'Harry', 'Dumbledore', 'Harry', 'Harry', 'Hallows', 'Harry', 'Hallows', 'Harry', 'Harry', 'Harry', 'Harry', 'second', 'Battle', 'Voldemort', 'one', 'Harry', 'Snape', 'Harry', 'Snape', 'Harry', 'Grindelwald', 'Dumbledore', 'Dumbledore', 'Harry', 'Harry', 'Dumbledore']",-0.9893,0

j7370h,"I love how basically every ""Why didn't Voldemort..."" question can just be explained by the fact that he's a total drama queen.","Why didn't Voldemort just let one of his many, many followers kill Harry when they had the chance? Because this is HIS show and he will NOT be upstaged.

Why didn't Voldemort make a Horcrux out of a grain of sand and chunk it into the ocean? Because he's the coolest wizard in the land who gave Death the middle finger, and so every Horcrux has to be something special or important.

Why didn't Voldemort just take a glock and shoot Harry in the face? Because aesthetics is everything and of COURSE he needs to kill Harry in the most dramatic way possible.

Why did Voldemort hatch and execute an extremely elaborate plan during Harry's fourth year involving several people that could have gone wrong at multiple points just to kidnap Harry, get his blood, and kill him? Because he's Lord Fucking Voldemort thankyouverymuch.

Why did Voldemort deduce that Harry was the Chosen One and not Neville? Because Harry was a half-blood wizard just like Voldemort so OF COURSE the Super Special Prophecied Chosen One Magical Boy Wizard would be exactly like Voldemort.

Why did Voldemort never learn to become an Animagus? Because he's the greatest wizard of all time and why would he ever choose to become a filthy animal howdareyou.

What did Voldemort do after he was denied a teaching job at Hogwarts? He literally placed a curse on that position because if he doesn't get the job, then no one does.

Why did Voldemort place a taboo on his own name? Because of course that's a practical way to find his enemies, but also because he has a great sense of Brand Integrity and he LOVES how iconic the whole ""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named"" stuff is.

Not to mention that he was so obsessed with theatrics and drama that he, as a teenage boy, not only probably spent hours every night writing in his diary and rearranging the letters of his name until he came up with ""I am Lord Voldemort"" and decided that would be an awesome name, but also started a club for emo racist goths and made all his friends actively call him that for the rest of his life.",11960,530,Captain_Cringe_,1602117996.0,0.95,Dungbomb,1602117996.0,True,"['Harry', 'Voldemort', 'Horcrux', 'Horcrux', 'Harry', 'Harry', 'Voldemort', 'Harry', 'fourth year', 'Harry', 'Voldemort', 'Harry', 'Neville', 'Harry', 'half', 'Voldemort', 'the Super Special Prophecied Chosen One', 'Voldemort', 'Voldemort', 'Voldemort', 'Voldemort', 'Brand Integrity', 'hours']",0.9437,0

I was reading and I realized, and growing up poor myself, I had given away things that I liked to people for Christmas or their birthday,  because I didn't have the money to buy them something else. I would give away a book or a game I really liked and told them I thought they would like it, which was true, I tried to give them something they would enjoy, but it was more because I couldn't go to the store to buy toys or something for really anyone. Ron's gift made me think of this, and I wonder if Ron did the same thing.
