      "But rereading it, I realized that she wasn't just worrying over nothing, Harry had been starved for weeks. The Dursleys were giving him the bare minimum of food, and what they were giving him (like cold canned soup that was mostly broth) had no real nutritious value. Harry mentions that he had been spending most of his time lying around on his bed and sleeping, probably because he didn't have the energy to do much else.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book describes Mrs. Weasley as being incredibly angry, right up until one of the twins mentions they had been starving Harry. When she then takes a second to actually see what bad shape Harry is in, almost all of the anger goes out of her. She's still a bit strict with the boys, but nowhere near as furious as she had been. We know Mrs. Weasley specialized in healing magic as well as cooking, and likely recognized all the signs of malnutrition in Harry. When she then monitors Harry as he's eating, and keeps giving him more, it's not a joke, it's because that's likely the first real meal he's had since he left Hogwarts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, during the conversation and meal, she makes a point of letting Harry know she's not angry with *him* when she starts yelling, and then constantly gives Harry praise and positive reinforcement.

      "His job doesn't pay him that well, and the department he heads, officially, isn't very powerful. Quite the contrary, his job is seen as kind of a joke. Nobody really cares about his department, it's mentioned that it's literally just him and one other guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, despite that, Arthur seems surprisingly well-connected. He's able to score the best possible seats money can buy to the Quidditch World Cup, he's able to push through his Muggle Protection Act despite being deeply unpopular with the rich and powerful, and several times mentions \"pulling strings\" or calling in favors within the Ministry throughout the series.\n",
      "\n",
      "And again, his department is seen as a joke, so it's not like he's well connected because his position is powerful, it's the opposite, his position only has what little power it does because Arthur is well-connected.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the actual reason as far as I can tell why he has so much pull is that ***people simply like him.*** They help him out because he's *nice.* Ludo Bagman gets him those perfects seats because Arthur had helped him previously, and all the Ministry employees (even Crouch) seem genuinely friendly with Arthur because he's earnestly, enthusiastically pleasant to every single person he meets. Arthur Weasley is revealed to be a much richer man than he first appears, but his wealth is in reputation in stead of gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's kind of the main theme of the entire series, isn't it? That true power is one's ability to connect with other people, to be *kind* to people, and being the kind of person that people want to help. It's a less extreme version of exactly what enables Harry to be the hero and win in the end.\n",

The basin is on a small island in the middle of a dark lake, and the only water you can drink is from said lake. That lake is filled with a giant army of inferi which of course can only be stopped by fire. You can only get to the basin in the middle of the lake by taking a boat that’s hidden at the bottom, and you can only find the boat by pulling on an invisible chain. The lake is in a cavern protected by a door that is practically undetectable to the unsuspecting wizard. The door can only be opened if you cut yourself and splatter your blood on the door. Oh, and the door is inside a random cave that’s super hard to get to in the first place.”  \n",

      "\n",
      "From the end of GoF, Dumbledore knew, or rather, he was extremely confident that Harry could no longer die by Voldemort’s hand. That is what the look of triumph in his eyes was when Harry told him about the blood Voldemort took from him. From that moment on, Dumbledore was trying to orchestrate a situation that would lead to Voldemort’s downfall with the least amount of sacrifice necessary. And he knew that in order to do that, Harry would need to sacrifice himself willingly. Not be told to die for others, but choose to of his own free will. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dumbledore could have had other very trustworthy people destroy the horcruxes. He had an entire group of highly devoted and skilled wizards at his disposal. But he needed it to be Harry - he needed Harry to see and fully understand what a perversion it was to seek immortality. Dumbledore leading the trio to the Deathly Hallows was also never meant to shield Harry from death - he was already protected. The Hallows were just meant to push Harry towards the inevitable conclusion: that the mastery of death is really the acceptance of death. If Harry understood this message, the choice would come naturally to him. \n",
      "\n",
      "He knew Harry couldn’t die. But if Harry thought he could, and chose to, the sacrifice magic would shield everyone in the second leg of the Battle, preventing many more casualties. The final thing to do was not to fight Voldemort with skill and power, but with the one thing he never understood, but which Harry had in spades: love for others.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why he never told Snape, he wanted Harry to receive only partial information. He didn’t care if that made him a villain in Snape’s eyes, as long as it led to Harry choosing to die willingly. It was the ultimate “greater good”, but so very different from how Grindelwald used the term. Dumbledore sacrificed everything, including his life, but he won, as everything worked out as he thought or even better than he thought it would.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sorry if this was discussed before, but I am seeing a lot of mindless hate for Dumbledore based off that quote. It seems to have become almost a default opinion in the fandom that Dumbledore was cruel and uncaring for orchestrating Harry’s death. That he didn’t give him a choice (when in fact Harry’s choice was the instrumental part). \n",
      "\n",
      "Dumbledore was flawed. He spent his whole life hiding from power, regretting what he did as a young man. But he was the furthest thing from cruel.\n",
